  BitSat network will be a free-to-use network, permitting anyone with compatible satellite receiver hardware to receive the latest bitcoin blocks.
  </p>
  <p>One of the key tenets is that bitcoin block data is easy to distribute widely.  Information wants to be free.  One of the ways we may keep bitcoin healthy and free is finding alternative ways to distribute block chain data.  This provides remote or off-grid bitcoin access, and some resilience in case the primary P2P mesh network is disrupted.  This also provides bitcoin access behind restrictive firewalls.</p>

  <p>Our personal favorite is satellite distribution, something we have been working on quietly in the background.  We call this project BitSat.  BitSat is currently a non-profit project, managed by Dunvegan Space Systems.</p>

  <h2 class='page-header'>Milestones</h2>

  <p>
    DSS is moving forward with Phase 1 of the project. Phase 1 is: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Flesh out cubesat specifications</li>
    <li>Research leased bandwidth pricing and specific data needs (xmit tech, frequencies)</li>
    <li>The initial goal is worldwide (or at least major continents) access to the latest bitcoin block.  Stretch goals include transmitting recent chains, recent TX's, and other data.</li>
  </ul>
